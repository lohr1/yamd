## Note on Code Organization

The project is split into "milestones" where each milestone has a specific goal and contributes something unique to the overall grade of the project. However, this is **NOT** how I would structure a project in a real-world setting. 

Furthermore, the organization and clarity of some code was affected by the fact that early milestones sometimes provided simplified code to work with as we learned basic concepts. This led to large changes in later milestones when the complexity was required to make more accurate predictions.
